<h1>Game Rules</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>The game has 2 players, playing in rounds</li>
        <li>In each turn, a player rolls the dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to the active player's CURRENT score</li>
        <li>BUT, if the player rolls a 1 on both dice, all their CURRENT score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn</li>
        <li>Each player can choose to 'HOLD', which means that their CURRENT score gets added to their tally. After that, it's the next player's turn</li>
        <li>The first player to reach 100 points wins the game and is declared the 'WINNER!' along with their winning score</li>

<h2>ENJOY !</h2>

    </ul>
